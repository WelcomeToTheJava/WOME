	<title>Kichwa Coders: The language server protocol will revolutionize how you code</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;lsps&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-3073&quot; src=&quot;https://kichwacoders.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/lsps.png?w=525&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next generation Spring Boot tooling has been completely refactored to be based on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol/blob/master/README.md&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;language server protocol&lt;/a&gt; (LSP). The tooling covers things like code assist for the Spring Boot property file, support for Cloud Foundry manifest files as well as Spring Boot support for Java files with typical features such as validation, content-assist and quick-fixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Beyond IDEs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-3063&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new generation of Spring tools, Spring Tools 4, will be &lt;a href=&quot;https://springoneplatform.io/sessions/spring-tools-4-eclipse-and-beyond&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fully unveiled at the SpringOne Platform conference later this year&lt;/a&gt;. Traditionally Spring tooling was written in Java as Eclipse plugins and could not be reused in other developer environments. The language server protocol enables Spring tooling to go beyond Eclipse and provide similarly great user experiences for Atom and Visual Studio Code, and likely any platform which implement language server clients. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol/wiki/Tools-supporting-the-Language-Server-Protocol&quot;&gt;list of clients&lt;/a&gt; supporting LSP is growing fast, even with Vi and emacs featuring it on their road-maps. In fact, the notable exception is IntelliJ. The market leader already has a well established language extension framework and the resources to keep up with language changes. It will be intriguing to see when and if they jump on the bandwagon and acknowledge the users &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEABKL-7409&quot;&gt;banging the door down&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Every Programming Language that Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the server side the number of protocol implementations is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol/wiki/Protocol-Implementations&quot;&gt;growing fast&lt;/a&gt;. There were 27 implementations back in June, my current count stands at 46. LSP easily makes sense for newer modern languages such as Typescript and Go, not to mention any domain-specific language. When it comes to languages with great IDE support such as Java, LSP is a big step back in functionality. However this could change quickly as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infoq.com/news/2017/09/Java6Month&quot;&gt;pace of Java releases quickens&lt;/a&gt;. Even for C/C++, LSP presents a chance to start afresh with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2017/april/article5.php&quot;&gt;a new approach&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;LSP: The Good, Bad &amp;amp; Ugly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At EclipseCon Europe, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/martinlippert&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Martin Lippert&lt;/a&gt; spoke about Pivotal’s journey to get Spring tooling to this stage and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017/session/implementing-language-servers-good-bad-ugly&quot;&gt;good, bad and ugly of language server protocols&lt;/a&gt;. Here are some of the highlights of his insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Good: Write once, run everywhere&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a no-brainer for toolsmiths to switch to something which enables them to creating tooling just once and make it readily available across different tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;building lightweight tooling (separation of client/server)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the freedom of starting fresh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;building the tooling once and reusing it across various environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;isolated testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;writing tools in the language most suited to the job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Bad: More features, better integration?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LSP covers many language features but is not feature-rich. Syntax highlighting is not included though readily handled by Textmate grammars. Other features such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol/issues/61&quot;&gt;advanced refactoring&lt;/a&gt; should fall within the remit of LSP so hopefully this will only  be a matter of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally there is no communication between language servers. If the Spring language tooling provides completions for Java in a property file, will it be able to reuse an existing Java LSP or does it have to launch its own and redo all the indexing and parsing work?  As things scale this will be interesting to see how interactions between language servers can best be handled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Ugly: More protocol please&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protocol itself isn’t quite enough of a protocol and still leaves room for interpretation. Which means the promise of client-agnostic language servers doesn’t fully exist yet. Currently each client behaves differently. For example each client has its own way to start a server and define an extension. Additionally every client is different, which for now means feature flags per client to work around issues, for example, for magic indentation on multi-line code completion (VS Code client indents using its own rules, Atom defers to the language server). Having more standardization on client implementation specifics and things like a client registry would make all the difference here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Language Server Protocol is the future of language tooling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Martin’s talk and the Spring tooling underlines is that there is no longer much debate about whether LSP is the future of language tooling. Now the conversation has shifted to what’s missing and how do we improve it. Developer communities and toolsmiths are restructuring to work together, be more effective and as a result revolutionize the landscape of our language tooling options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/kichwacoders.wordpress.com/3063/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/kichwacoders.wordpress.com/3063/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=kichwacoders.com&amp;amp;blog=68353182&amp;amp;post=3063&amp;amp;subd=kichwacoders&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Benjamin Cabe: Enter the Open IoT Challenge 4.0: some ideas for your submission</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://blog.benjamin-cabe.com/?p=2969</guid>
	<link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/benjamin-cabe-planet-eclipse/~3/RsiTCX4Xi9E/enter-open-iot-challenge-4-0-some-ideas-for-your-submission</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;There are only a couple weeks left (deadline is Nov. 13) for entering the fourth edition of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iot.eclipse.org/open-iot-challenge/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open IoT Challenge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Open IoT Challenge encourages IoT enthusiasts and developers to build innovative solutions for the Internet of Things using open standards and open source technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Open IoT Challenge 4.0&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-2975 size-full&quot; height=&quot;283&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.benjamin-cabe.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/challenge4.png&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably remember &lt;a href=&quot;https://iot.eclipse.org/open-iot-challenge/third-edition/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;last year’s edition&lt;/a&gt; and its winner, Sébastien Lambour, who built an amazing solution: &lt;strong&gt;InTheMoodForLife.&lt;/strong&gt; The project aims at &lt;strong&gt;analyzing sleep patterns&lt;/strong&gt; to anticipate mood disorder episodes for people suffering from &lt;strong&gt;bipolar disorder&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sébastien won $3,000, and we also provided him with an additional $1,000 to fund his participation in Eclipse IoT events where he presented his project. For example, Sébastien attended the Eclipse IoT Day in London, a couple months ago, and gave a brilliant talk where he shared his experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, there is already a nice incentive for you to enter the challenge, even if you feel like you can’t compete for the first place (and you shouldn’t feel like that, by the way!). In fact, &lt;strong&gt;if you are among the 10 best submissions, our jury will award you a $150 gift certificate&lt;/strong&gt; that will help you buy the hardware you need to build your project!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought it would be useful to share some of the ideas I would like to see come to life, and some of the technologies that I think would be interesting to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deep learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/eclipse-deeplearning4j&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Deeplearning4j moving to Eclipse,&lt;/a&gt; now is the perfect time to think of having &lt;strong&gt;deep learning&lt;/strong&gt; play a role in your project. Whether you plan on doing image recognition, predictive maintenance, or natural language processing, I am curious to see if &lt;a href=&quot;https://deeplearning4j.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Deeplearning4j&lt;/a&gt;, or other open source projects in the machine learning / deep learning area, can help you implement your solution. There are some IoT gateways out there that are fairly capable, and even some that include a GPU, so please be crazy and push the boundaries of edge computing! &lt;img alt=&quot;🙂&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; src=&quot;https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png&quot; style=&quot;height: 1em;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Industrial IoT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many – too many, probably – IoT solutions are very consumer oriented (connected toothbrush anyone?), so I certainly hope to see lots of projects that are more &lt;strong&gt;industry-focused&lt;/strong&gt;. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iot.eclipse.org/testbeds/production-performance-management/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;production performance management testbed&lt;/a&gt; can probably give you some pointers regarding open source projects that are applicable, and even provide you some &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipselabs/eclipseiot-testbed-productionperformancemanagement&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt; to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Blockchain and distributed ledgers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the buzzword and the hype, &lt;strong&gt;blockchain&lt;/strong&gt; is still an interesting topic, which you may want to put to use in your Open IoT Challenge project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security is one key aspect of IoT. Blockchain might be a way for you to secure communications or data exchanges, but it is also interesting to think about using distributed ledgers as a way to enable a sharing economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you could “share” some of your IoT devices’ processing or networking power and get compensated, in a secure way, using a blockchain? And how about true “pay-per-use” scenarios, where e.g construction companies share a pool of high-value power tools for which actual usage is tracked, logged, and billed accordingly, through a blockchain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.benjamin-cabe.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Iota_logo.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-2988&quot; height=&quot;101&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.benjamin-cabe.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Iota_logo-300x101.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Of particular interest, in my opinion, is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iota.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;IOTA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, an open source distributed ledger which, by design, has no transaction fees (it has no miners, as the 2,779,530,283,277,761 (!) tokens that form the ‘tangle’ were all generated in the so-called genesis transaction).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that you can leverage the IOTA tangle to implement secured micro-transactions in your IoT solution, e.g to expose (and monetize) sensor data to the world. I would be particularly curious to see how IOTA performs on constrained devices, and how well it scales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Low-power, long-life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.benjamin-cabe.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/mangOH-Red-510x288.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;MangOH Red&quot; class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-2983&quot; height=&quot;201&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.benjamin-cabe.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/mangOH-Red-510x288-300x201.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;One of our sponsors this year, Sierra Wireless, will be providing the 10 best proposals with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://mangoh.io/mangoh-red&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MangOH Red&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; IoT board. This board is perfectly suited for low-power IoT applications and would be the ideal partner in crime if running for years out of a small battery is important to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is often an afterthought in IoT to think about the maintenance of the equipment. I am interested in seeing how your proposal will &lt;strong&gt;highlight how you plan on making your solution easy to operate&lt;/strong&gt;, including things like &lt;strong&gt;over-the-air updates&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;energy consumption optimization&lt;/strong&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not sure if your idea would make for a cool project, feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.benjamin-cabe.com/contact&quot;&gt;ping me&lt;/a&gt;, I will be happy to give you some feedback &lt;img alt=&quot;🙂&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; src=&quot;https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png&quot; style=&quot;height: 1em;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am looking forward to reviewing your proposals, and seeing all the cool projects you will be building over the next few months!&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Benjamin Cabe: 4 Takeaways from “All Things IoT” week at EclipseCon Europe</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://blog.benjamin-cabe.com/?p=2945</guid>
	<link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/benjamin-cabe-planet-eclipse/~3/vClHEGA6I8U/4-takeaways-from-all-things-iot-week-at-eclipsecon-europe</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, the Eclipse IoT community was pretty busy at EclipseCon Europe. We were having our largest Eclipse event of the year, and it featured lots of IoT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a much needed weekend break to recover from an incredibly fruitful week, I am taking some time to write down some of my personal takeaways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and before you ask: we are working on uploading all the IoT sessions from the IoT Working Group meeting and IoT Day to YouTube. They will be available shortly, and as you can see in the blog post below, some of them already are! &lt;img alt=&quot;🙂&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; src=&quot;https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png&quot; style=&quot;height: 1em;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IoT Day featured lots of real-world talks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.benjamin-cabe.com/2017/11/02/4-takeaways-from-all-things-iot-week-at-eclipsecon-europe/20171024_111939&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Müge Kural, Eteration&quot; class=&quot;attachment-medium size-medium&quot; height=&quot;169&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.benjamin-cabe.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/20171024_111939-300x169.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.benjamin-cabe.com/2017/11/02/4-takeaways-from-all-things-iot-week-at-eclipsecon-europe/20171024_153927_1000&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Müge Kural, Eteration&quot; class=&quot;attachment-medium size-medium&quot; height=&quot;169&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.benjamin-cabe.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/20171024_153927_1000-300x169.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was really pleased with the turnout of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017/iot-day&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;IoT Day&lt;/a&gt;. What was particularly interesting was hearing not only community insiders tell us about what they are doing for, and with, Eclipse IoT projects, but also getting the point of view of people who are pure consumers of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, for example, we had people like Müge Kural (Eteration) or Nicola La Gloria (Kynetics) telling us how projects like Eclipse Kura or Eclipse hawkBit have helped them implement use cases such as &lt;strong&gt;advanced dashboards for Electric Vehicles&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;scalable software updates for Android-based IoT devices&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look out for the video recordings of their talks, in the meantime, you can read more about Kynetics’ story in our recently published &lt;a href=&quot;https://iot.eclipse.org/case-studies/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;case study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Eclipse IoT Testbeds Hackday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot; id=&quot;attachment_2949&quot; style=&quot;width: 300px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.benjamin-cabe.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/20171025_103300_1000.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Open IoT Testbed Hackday at EclipseCon Europe&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-2949 size-medium&quot; height=&quot;169&quot; src=&quot;https://blog.benjamin-cabe.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/20171025_103300_1000-300x169.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Open IoT Testbed Hackday at EclipseCon Europe&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you probably know by now, we are ramping up our &lt;a href=&quot;https://iot.eclipse.org/testbeds&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Open IoT Testbeds&lt;/a&gt; initiative, and it was great to use EclipseCon Europe as an opportunity to spend some quality time with the different companies involved in the testbeds and discuss next steps. To encourage collaboration, we held a “hackday” on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a strong focus on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://iot.eclipse.org/testbeds/production-performance-management/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Industry 4.0 / Production Performance Management testbed&lt;/a&gt;, and it was great to see participants from different companies sitting at the same table, brainstorming about the roadmap for the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my action items from the hackday was to get a mailing list set up. So, &lt;strong&gt;if you want to get more involved in the testbeds&lt;/strong&gt;, you can now &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/iot-testbeds&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;subscribe to iot-testbeds@eclipse.org&lt;/a&gt; to participate!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It’s all about the integration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EclipseCon Europe coincides with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.benjamin-cabe.com/2012/10/08/m2m-at-eclipsecon-europe&quot;&gt;anniversary of the Eclipse IoT Working Group,&lt;/a&gt; and 6 years into the adventure it is great to see that this year, even more than others, the project teams spent a lot of time discussing how to better integrate the different projects with one another. For example, it has become pretty clear that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/hono/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Eclipse hono&lt;/a&gt; will probably become the de-facto standard for device connectivity, and there were lots of discussions on how to provide hono protocol adapters for PPMP (Eclipse Unide), OPC-UA (Eclipse Milo), or Eclipse Kura gateways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, at the IoT WG meeting, we discussed how to structure the community work better and collaborate towards a more integrated Eclipse IoT stack. It has been proposed that we establish a sub-committee of the IoT WG dedicated to integration work. Expect to see more on that topic soon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New projects got unveiled&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have seen the news: just a week before EclipseCon, &lt;strong&gt;two new Eclipse IoT project proposals have been announced&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First is &lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/eclipse-thingweb&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eclipse Thingweb&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a project that will be hosting an open-source toolkit for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/WoT/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;W3C Web of Things&lt;/a&gt; ecosystem. Matthias Kovatsch from Siemens presented the project, and you can get his slides &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.eclipse.org/images/7/73/2017_Thingweb-Proposal.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other project, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/eclipse-cyclone&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Eclipse Cyclone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, will put an open source implementation of the DDS (Data Distribution Service) middleware standard of IoT developers. Hans van’t Hag from ADLINK gave the presentation below, and his slides are &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.eclipse.org/images/e/ed/Eclipse_cyclone.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am looking forward to seeing these projects move to Eclipse IoT over the next few months!&lt;/p&gt;

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Has it only been six months? You accomplished so much already! Looking forward to another 6 months. Thank you for making it easy for so many new and some old contributors to contribute to Eclipse Collections!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=481ce1634241&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Michael Vorburger: java.security.InvalidAlgorithmParameterException: the trustAnchors parameter must be non-empty</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2224194412636345302.post-7968449067941517108</guid>

	<description>When I first tried out to run my Eclipse IDE under the recently release Java 9, I just downloaded an OpenJDK 9 TGZ from &lt;a href=&quot;http://jdk.java.net/9/&quot;&gt;http://jdk.java.net/9/&lt;/a&gt; (because on Fedora 26 there didn't seem to be an RPM package, yet; I'm sure this will come in Fedora 27).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eclipse then gave me the InvalidAlgorithmParameterException error shown below, and this fixed it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;&quot;&gt;mv ~/bin/jdk-9/lib/security/cacerts{,.original}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;&quot;&gt;ln -s /etc/pki/java/cacerts ~/bin/jdk-9/lib/security/cacerts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this little tip is useful for others as well; give me a &quot;thumbs up&quot; +1 comment if it is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; font-size: xx-small;&quot;&gt;eclipse.buildId=4.8.0.I20170913-2000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;

	<title>Donald Raab: Lazy and inexhaustible</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://medium.com/p/f41ffda857dc</guid>
	<link>https://medium.com/@donraab/lazy-and-inexhaustible-f41ffda857dc?source=rss-df39b86e9f04------2</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Laziness is a virtue. Sometimes you want it to be repeatable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0gjyUH1TFyDKHZCiFlYLVA.jpeg&quot; /&gt;The lazy hazy crazy days of summer are gone but will be back again.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In programming, laziness can be a very good thing. Lazy initialization allows us to avoid creating expensive resources until they are needed. Lazy iteration allows us to avoid creating temporary data structures and potentially to reduce the total amount of work needed in order to perform a computation. Two built-in paradigms existed for lazy iteration in Java before Java 8. They are &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Iterable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Iterator&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. An Iterable can be used over and over again, as it can continue to give you a brand new Iterator. An Iterator can only be used once, as there is no way to reset it once you’ve gotten to the last element via next().&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Java 8, Streams were added with methods that are lazy (e.g. map, filter, etc.). Stream is like an Iterator, in that it can only be used once with a terminal operation like forEach or collect. This means you have to be careful not to exhaust a Stream and then try and use it again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what will happen at runtime if you try and use a Stream more than once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;java.lang.IllegalStateException: stream has already been operated upon or closed&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am going to use the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;getAgeStatisticsOfPets&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; test in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections-kata/blob/master/pet-kata/src/test/java/org/eclipse/collections/petkata/Exercise4Test.java#L35&quot;&gt;Exercise 4 of the Eclipse Collections Pet Kata &lt;/a&gt;to illustrate how you can work with a Stream without getting an IllegalStateException. I will also show you some other alternatives that are lazy using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections&quot;&gt;Eclipse Collections&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, here’s the code I would like to write for the test in Exercise 4 of the Pet Kata. I am using an IntStream (obtained via mapToInt) in order to avoid boxing ints as Integers. This code compiles but will fail upon execution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;@Test&lt;br /&gt;public void getAgeStatisticsOfPets()&lt;br /&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;    IntStream petAges = this.people&lt;br /&gt;            .stream()&lt;br /&gt;            .flatMap(person -&amp;gt; person.getPets().stream())&lt;br /&gt;            .mapToInt(Pet::getAge);&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    Set&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt; uniqueAges =&lt;br /&gt;        petAges.boxed().collect(Collectors.&lt;em&gt;toSet&lt;/em&gt;());&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    IntSummaryStatistics stats = petAges.summaryStatistics();&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(Sets.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;mutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.with(1, 2, 3, 4), uniqueAges);&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(stats.getMin(), petAges.min().getAsInt());&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(stats.getMax(), petAges.max().getAsInt());&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(stats.getSum(), petAges.sum());&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(stats.getAverage(),&lt;br /&gt;                        petAges.average().getAsDouble(), 0.0);&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(stats.getCount(), petAges.count());&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertTrue&lt;/em&gt;(petAges.allMatch(i -&amp;gt; i &amp;gt; 0));&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertFalse&lt;/em&gt;(petAges.anyMatch(i -&amp;gt; i == 0));&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertTrue&lt;/em&gt;(petAges.noneMatch(i -&amp;gt; i &amp;lt; 0));&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The code will run until this line attempts to execute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;IntSummaryStatistics stats = petAges.summaryStatistics();&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s when the IllegalStateException is thrown. The call to collect in the previous line caused the Stream to become exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One option I have to make the code work is to pre-calculate the pets as a flattened List and then recreate the IntStream for the ages as I need them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;@Test&lt;br /&gt;public void getAgeStatisticsOfPets()&lt;br /&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;    List&amp;lt;Pet&amp;gt; petAges = this.people&lt;br /&gt;            .stream()&lt;br /&gt;            .flatMap(person -&amp;gt; person.getPets().stream())&lt;br /&gt;            .collect(Collectors.&lt;em&gt;toList(&lt;/em&gt;));&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    Set&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt; uniqueAges =&lt;br /&gt;            petAges.stream()&lt;br /&gt;                    .mapToInt(Pet::getAge)&lt;br /&gt;                    .boxed()&lt;br /&gt;                    .collect(Collectors.&lt;em&gt;toSet&lt;/em&gt;());&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    IntSummaryStatistics stats =&lt;br /&gt;            petAges.stream()&lt;br /&gt;                    .mapToInt(Pet::getAge)&lt;br /&gt;                    .summaryStatistics();&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(Sets.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;mutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.with(1, 2, 3, 4), uniqueAges);&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(stats.getMin(), petAges.stream()&lt;br /&gt;            .mapToInt(Pet::getAge).min().getAsInt());&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(stats.getMax(), petAges.stream()&lt;br /&gt;            .mapToInt(Pet::getAge).max().getAsInt());&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(stats.getSum(), petAges.stream()&lt;br /&gt;            .mapToInt(Pet::getAge).sum());&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(stats.getAverage(), petAges.stream()&lt;br /&gt;                    .mapToInt(Pet::getAge).average().getAsDouble(),&lt;br /&gt;            0.0);&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(stats.getCount(), petAges.size());&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertTrue&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;br /&gt;            petAges.stream()&lt;br /&gt;                    .mapToInt(Pet::getAge)&lt;br /&gt;                    .allMatch(i -&amp;gt; i &amp;gt; 0));&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertFalse&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;br /&gt;            petAges.stream()&lt;br /&gt;                    .mapToInt(Pet::getAge)&lt;br /&gt;                    .anyMatch(i -&amp;gt; i == 0));&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertTrue&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;br /&gt;            petAges.stream()&lt;br /&gt;                    .mapToInt(Pet::getAge)&lt;br /&gt;                    .noneMatch(i -&amp;gt; i &amp;lt; 0));&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This works but I had to write a lot of duplicate code. I have to call this code over and over again to recreate the IntStream of pet ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;petAges.stream().mapToInt(Pet::getAge)&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I do not like duplicating code, I want to find a solution for this problem. One solution would be to put this duplicate code in a Supplier and calculate it on demand by calling the get() method on the Supplier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;@Test&lt;br /&gt;public void getAgeStatisticsOfPets()&lt;br /&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;    List&amp;lt;Pet&amp;gt; pets = this.people&lt;br /&gt;            .stream()&lt;br /&gt;            .flatMap(person -&amp;gt; person.getPets().stream())&lt;br /&gt;            .collect(Collectors.&lt;em&gt;toList&lt;/em&gt;());&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    Supplier&amp;lt;IntStream&amp;gt; petAges =&lt;br /&gt;            () -&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;pets&lt;/em&gt;.stream().mapToInt(Pet::getAge);&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    Set&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt; uniqueAges =&lt;br /&gt;            petAges.get().boxed().collect(Collectors.&lt;em&gt;toSet&lt;/em&gt;());&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    IntSummaryStatistics stats =&lt;br /&gt;            petAges.get().summaryStatistics();&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(Sets.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;mutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.with(1, 2, 3, 4), uniqueAges);&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(stats.getMin(), &lt;br /&gt;            petAges.get().min().getAsInt());&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(stats.getMax(), &lt;br /&gt;            petAges.get().max().getAsInt());&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(stats.getSum(), &lt;br /&gt;            petAges.get().sum());&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(stats.getAverage(), &lt;br /&gt;            petAges.get().average().getAsDouble(),&lt;br /&gt;            0.0);&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(stats.getCount(), &lt;br /&gt;            petAges.get().count());&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertTrue&lt;/em&gt;(petAges.get().allMatch(i -&amp;gt; i &amp;gt; 0));&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertFalse&lt;/em&gt;(petAges.get().anyMatch(i -&amp;gt; i == 0));&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertTrue&lt;/em&gt;(petAges.get().noneMatch(i -&amp;gt; i &amp;lt; 0));&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This reduces the amount of duplicate code I had to write. I can go one step further and make the flatCollect not have to collect into a List, by having the Supplier do more of the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;@Test&lt;br /&gt;public void getAgeStatisticsOfPets()&lt;br /&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;    Supplier&amp;lt;IntStream&amp;gt; petAges =&lt;br /&gt;            () -&amp;gt; this.people&lt;br /&gt;                    .stream()&lt;br /&gt;                    .flatMap(person -&amp;gt; person.getPets().stream())&lt;br /&gt;                    .mapToInt(Pet::getAge);&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    Set&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt; uniqueAges =&lt;br /&gt;            petAges.get().boxed().collect(Collectors.&lt;em&gt;toSet&lt;/em&gt;());&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    IntSummaryStatistics stats =&lt;br /&gt;            petAges.get().summaryStatistics();&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(Sets.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;mutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.with(1, 2, 3, 4), uniqueAges);&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(stats.getMin(),&lt;br /&gt;            petAges.get().min().getAsInt());&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(stats.getMax(),&lt;br /&gt;            petAges.get().max().getAsInt());&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(stats.getSum(),&lt;br /&gt;            petAges.get().sum());&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(stats.getAverage(),&lt;br /&gt;            petAges.get().average().getAsDouble(),&lt;br /&gt;            0.0);&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(stats.getCount(),&lt;br /&gt;            petAges.get().count());&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertTrue&lt;/em&gt;(petAges.get().allMatch(i -&amp;gt; i &amp;gt; 0));&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertFalse&lt;/em&gt;(petAges.get().anyMatch(i -&amp;gt; i == 0));&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertTrue&lt;/em&gt;(petAges.get().noneMatch(i -&amp;gt; i &amp;lt; 0));&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This almost feels like creating a lazy Iterable, where each time we need to do something, we create an Iterator to perform an additional function. In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eclipse.org/collections/&quot;&gt;Eclipse Collections&lt;/a&gt;, there is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eclipse.org/collections/javadoc/9.0.0/org/eclipse/collections/api/LazyIterable.html&quot;&gt;LazyIterable&lt;/a&gt; type, that can be created from any &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eclipse.org/collections/javadoc/9.0.0/org/eclipse/collections/api/RichIterable.html#asLazy--&quot;&gt;RichIterable&lt;/a&gt;. A LazyIterable can be used safely as many times as you want. It may be expensive to recalculate the functions over and over again, but it will allow you to do so and will not become exhausted after the first time you use it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following shows how you can solve this problem using a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eclipse.org/collections/javadoc/9.0.0/org/eclipse/collections/api/LazyIntIterable.html&quot;&gt;LazyIntIterable&lt;/a&gt; with Eclipse Collections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;@Test&lt;br /&gt;public void getAgeStatisticsOfPets()&lt;br /&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;    LazyIntIterable petAges = this.people&lt;br /&gt;            .asLazy()&lt;br /&gt;            .flatCollect(Person::getPets)&lt;br /&gt;            .collectInt(Pet::getAge);&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    IntSet uniqueAges = petAges.toSet();&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    IntSummaryStatistics stats = petAges.summaryStatistics();&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;br /&gt;            IntSets.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;mutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.with(1, 2, 3, 4),&lt;br /&gt;            uniqueAges);&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(stats.getMin(), petAges.min());&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(stats.getMax(), petAges.max());&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(stats.getSum(), petAges.sum());&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(stats.getAverage(), petAges.average(), 0.0);&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(stats.getCount(), petAges.size());&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertTrue&lt;/em&gt;(petAges.allSatisfy(i -&amp;gt; i &amp;gt; 0));&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertFalse&lt;/em&gt;(petAges.anySatisfy(i -&amp;gt; i == 0));&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertTrue&lt;/em&gt;(petAges.noneSatisfy(i -&amp;gt; i &amp;lt; 0));&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once I have a LazyIntIterable, I do not need to box the unique ages into a Set of Integer. I can instead store them in an IntSet as I have above, simply by calling toSet() on the LazyIntIterable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because LazyIntIterable is Lazy, it does not pre-calculate and store the pet ages. It has to execute the flatCollect() and collectInt() each time you call a terminal method like toSet, summaryStatistics, min, max, sum, average, size, any/all/noneSatisfy. If I want the code to be more efficient, I can pre-calculate the pet ages and store them in an IntList or IntBag. I will use an IntBag here, as there are duplicate ages but order doesn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;@Test&lt;br /&gt;public void getAgeStatisticsOfPets()&lt;br /&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;    IntBag petAges = this.people&lt;br /&gt;            .asLazy()&lt;br /&gt;            .flatCollect(Person::getPets)&lt;br /&gt;            .collectInt(Pet::getAge)&lt;br /&gt;            .toBag();&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    IntSet uniqueAges = petAges.toSet();&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    IntSummaryStatistics stats = petAges.summaryStatistics();&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;br /&gt;            IntSets.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;mutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.with(1, 2, 3, 4),&lt;br /&gt;            uniqueAges);&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(stats.getMin(), petAges.min());&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(stats.getMax(), petAges.max());&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(stats.getSum(), petAges.sum());&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(stats.getAverage(), petAges.average(), 0.0);&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(stats.getCount(), petAges.size());&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertTrue&lt;/em&gt;(petAges.allSatisfy(i -&amp;gt; i &amp;gt; 0));&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertFalse&lt;/em&gt;(petAges.anySatisfy(i -&amp;gt; i == 0));&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertTrue&lt;/em&gt;(petAges.noneSatisfy(i -&amp;gt; i &amp;lt; 0));&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;All I had to change in the code to make this work was to call the method toBag() after calling collectInt() and change the type of petAges from &lt;em&gt;LazyIntIterable&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;IntBag&lt;/em&gt;. No other code needed to change. This is because our primitive collections and primitive lazy iterables in Eclipse Collections have &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@donraab/symmetric-sympathy-2c59d4541d60&quot;&gt;good symmetry&lt;/a&gt;. Notice how there is no boxing of ints to Integer objects in either the &lt;em&gt;LazyIntIterable&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;IntBag&lt;/em&gt; solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can easily change the type from &lt;em&gt;IntBag&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;IntList&lt;/em&gt;, just by changing the toBag() method call to toList().&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;@Test&lt;br /&gt;public void getAgeStatisticsOfPets()&lt;br /&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;    IntList petAges = this.people.asLazy()&lt;br /&gt;            .flatCollect(Person::getPets)&lt;br /&gt;            .collectInt(Pet::getAge)&lt;br /&gt;            .toList();&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    IntSet uniqueAges = petAges.toSet();&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    IntSummaryStatistics stats = petAges.summaryStatistics();&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;br /&gt;            IntSets.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;mutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.with(1, 2, 3, 4),&lt;br /&gt;            uniqueAges);&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(stats.getMin(), petAges.min());&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(stats.getMax(), petAges.max());&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(stats.getSum(), petAges.sum());&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(stats.getAverage(), petAges.average(), 0.0);&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(stats.getCount(), petAges.size());&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertTrue&lt;/em&gt;(petAges.allSatisfy(i -&amp;gt; i &amp;gt; 0));&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertFalse&lt;/em&gt;(petAges.anySatisfy(i -&amp;gt; i == 0));&lt;br /&gt;    Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertTrue&lt;/em&gt;(petAges.noneSatisfy(i -&amp;gt; i &amp;lt; 0));&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again, nothing else needs to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you call min, max and average on an IntStream, you will get an OptionalInt or OptionalDouble. This is a good thing if you have the potential to have an empty result. OptionalInt and OptionalDouble will allow you to handle the cases where the result is empty. With Eclipse Collections, there is a different option for these three methods to help in the case where the iterable or collection is empty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(stats.getMin(), petAges.minIfEmpty(0));&lt;br /&gt;Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(stats.getMax(), petAges.maxIfEmpty(0));&lt;br /&gt;Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(stats.getSum(), petAges.sum());&lt;br /&gt;Assert.&lt;em&gt;assertEquals&lt;/em&gt;(stats.getAverage(), petAges.averageIfEmpty(0.0), 0.0);&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The methods minIfEmpty, maxIfEmpty and averageIfEmpty allow you to specify a default value to use in the case of an empty result. In the future, we may also add minOptional, maxOptional and averageOptional if there is a need for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you use Streams, and want them to be re-usable, then consider using them in conjunction with a Supplier. This will reduce the amount of duplicate code you will have to write. If you want inexhaustible laziness out of the box, then consider using Eclipse Collections, as you will get a lot of additional options that you can use in addition to Streams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope this blog was useful and informative and showed some options for using Streams and Eclipse Collections LazyIterables effectively to solve the same problems. I also hope that you try out the Eclipse Collections katas on your own. I often teach the katas using both Streams and Eclipse Collections so developers can learn both APIs and understand what options they have available to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=f41ffda857dc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Doug Schaefer: EclipseCon Europe 2017 Quick Wrap Up</title>

	<description>&lt;div class=&quot;kg-card-markdown&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;EclipseCon Europe 2017 Quick Wrap Up&quot; src=&quot;https://cdtdoug.ca/content/images/2017/10/20171023_174547.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;My favorite EclipseCon of the many I've attended happened at one of the earliest ones. Of course there have been many good onces since, but this one was different because of the vibe that was happening. This was the 2005 edition at beautiful Hyatt Regency in Burlingame, California, our first in the &quot;Valley&quot;. It was a time when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/org/press-release/20050301eclipseconcommunity.htm&quot;&gt;companies were clamoring&lt;/a&gt; to be a part of the community. Borland was jumping head first to compete with IBM in the modeling space by joining as an Eclipse Strategic Member and that threw the IBM/Rational team into a tizzy as it had to learn how to work with a competitor in the open. It was so much fun to sit in the front row and watch the industry change in front of us in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EclipseCon Europe 2017 showed progress back towards that excitement. With a steady attendance of 600+, it really is the main event on the yearly calendar, at least for now. With all the activity recently around Java with Java EE moving to Eclipse and IBM finally releasing their J9 VM to the open, there's definitely a vibe in the air that brings back memories of those early EclipseCons. It will be very interesting to see how this evolves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, enough about Java :). It was a very good EclipseCon for Eclipse CDT project and tools for Embedded in general, probably the best since the glory days when we had our own CDT Summit events in the Montreal-Ottawa-Toronto corridor. As I put it to someone, &quot;CDT needs new blood and there's some blood on the doorstep, just need to get it inside.&quot; And I'm very excited to see some of the CDT contributors stepping up to help with some much needed revitalization of CDT's build system in the upcoming months. And with Jonah's work on the Debug Server Protocol and all the work going into the Language Server Protocol and the clangd language server, we're poised to bring CDT to a new generation that expect a more modern and lightweight experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final word for now, I have to reiterate what I said on Twitter and Facebook how incredibly honored I am to receive this year's Eclipse Lifetime Contribution Award. Those who know me well know I'm a very shy and introverted person. But there's always been something about the great people in the Eclipse community that brings me out of my shell. They make me feel a part of the family. For that I am and will be forever grateful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've made so many friends along the way and I am immensely proud of what we as a community have built. I share this honor with everyone I've worked with and everyone whose helped me along the way, especially to QNX for giving me the responsibility to represent them in the community and to John Duimovich and CDT's first great leader Sebastien Marineau who made this crazy gamble to entrust me with the CDT project leadership :). All I can say is Thank You!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any way. I promised people at EclipseCon I'd write more. There's so much going on and my involvement and interest continues to grow as exciting new technologies are becoming mainstream (think embedded systems meets cloud meets artificial intelligence and all the runtime and tool needs in between). So much to write about. I can't wait to get into it.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Karsten Thoms: EclipseCon Europe 2017 – Part 2</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://kthoms.wordpress.com/?p=902</guid>
	<link>https://kthoms.wordpress.com/2017/10/27/eclipsecon-europe-2017-part-2/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;This time I really had to split up my look back to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017&quot;&gt;EclipseCon Europe&lt;/a&gt; into multiple posts. In my previous post I wrote my rememberings on ECE 2017 before it actually began. It was about my arrival and first meetings with the community, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017/unconference&quot;&gt;Unconference&lt;/a&gt; on Monday and the reception and networking at the Nestor bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;image-uploaded-from-ios11.jpg&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-951&quot; src=&quot;https://kthoms.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/image-uploaded-from-ios11-e1509132419546.jpg?w=584&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday it was finally time to open the doors for EclipseCon Europe! It is already beginning at the reception and wardrobe where you meet lots of people and welcome them. Of course there is not much time then, but I was looking forward to find more time for chatting later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Preparing for showtime&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday morning is the tutorials slot. I would have liked to join Mickael Istria’s slot on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017/session/language-edition-support-eclipse-ide-best-breed-generic-editor-language-servers-and-textmate&quot;&gt;Language Server Protocol and Eclipse’s Generic Editor&lt;/a&gt;. This is definetely a topic where I will bring my experience in and will contribute to. Instead, I chose to prepare for my first talks on that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All itemis colleagues met at our booth and we built it up together. The booth played a central role for us later and we wanted to make it an interesting place to be for attendees also. And hey – we had stickers this year again! I ordered them recently and improved my Gimp skills to make them free form cuts. The quality is good, and now we know where to order good ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;IMG_4663.jpg&quot; class=&quot;  wp-image-955 alignnone&quot; height=&quot;295&quot; src=&quot;https://kthoms.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_46631.jpg?w=393&amp;amp;h=295&quot; width=&quot;393&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At noon it was time to meet up again. Not sure with whom I joined that day. I think it was Tuesday where I joined Lorenzo Bettini and Francesco and Vincenso from RCP Vision. Or already Monday? I have an information overload to get this correct in a row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Keynotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lunch it was time for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017/session/welcoming-remarks-eclipse-state-union-theater&quot;&gt;opening keynote from Mike Milinkovich&lt;/a&gt;. But before that, Ludwigsburg’s mayor gave an insight on Ludwigsburg’s history. You may have read it, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.focus.de/regional/baden-wuerttemberg/stadt-ludwigsburg-eclipsecon-europe-bleibt-in-ludwigsburg_id_7724435.html&quot;&gt;the Eclipse Foundation and Ludwigsburg agreed to keep EclipseCon Europe further for at least two years&lt;/a&gt; there. Good choice. The location is just perfect for this conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it became time for Mike to welcome the audience and have an outlook on the future of Eclipse. These are exciting times, many projects are joining the Eclipse Foundation. With the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mmilinkov.wordpress.com/2017/09/12/java-ee-moves-to-the-eclipse-foundation/&quot;&gt;move of JavaEE to EE4J at Eclipse&lt;/a&gt;, not less than 40 new projects are pushing in, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/10/03/java_ee_goes_eclipse_now_what/&quot;&gt;GlassFish alone has 130 git repos&lt;/a&gt;. It will be a challenging task to spark this project. I don’t want to get into the details now, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://jaxenter.com/open-source-eclipse-openj9-137263.html&quot;&gt;OpenJ9&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/3dx156Nfix&quot;&gt;Deeplearning4J&lt;/a&gt; are other awesome projects at the Foundation now. &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.eclipse.org/&quot;&gt;Eclipse Science&lt;/a&gt; is also getting things rolling and are &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.eclipse.org/content/eclipse-science-2017-simultaneous-release-here&quot;&gt;successful on their own release train&lt;/a&gt; now. The Eclipse IDE supports now Java 9 and JUnit 5 and has been added to Eclipse Oxygen.1a and Photon. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/org/press-release/20170829eplv2.php&quot;&gt;Eclipse Public License 2.0 has been released this year&lt;/a&gt;, and JUnit 5 was the first project licensed under EPL-2.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;IMG_4665.jpg&quot; class=&quot;  wp-image-961 aligncenter&quot; height=&quot;328&quot; src=&quot;https://kthoms.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_4665.jpg?w=437&amp;amp;h=328&quot; width=&quot;437&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to admit that I was distracted during &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017/session/digitalization-%E2%80%93-good-bad-and-ugly-theater&quot;&gt;Anna Ståhlbröst’s keynote&lt;/a&gt; then. I partially followed and enjoyed how she presented live in Luleå, near to the polar circle in northern Sweden. The reason for distraction was that it was immediately after the keynote time for my next talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;itemis Booth Talks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it was finally time for an idea that we had for our booth. The idea was to use our technical and presentation skills and give short talks at the booth. The short break between the keynotes and the afternoon talks was used by Lothar Wendehals, and he showed in just 5 minutes how to program an embedded system with our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.itemis.com/en/yakindu/state-machine/&quot;&gt;YAKINDU Statechart Tools&lt;/a&gt;. And it took not more time until he programmed an Arduino to do something which he modeled as a finite state machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;screenshot 130&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-968&quot; src=&quot;https://kthoms.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/screenshot-130.png?w=584&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Showtime!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017/session/introduction-expression-languages-xtext&quot;&gt;Introduction to Expression Languages with Xtext&lt;/a&gt;” I showed how to build languages in Xtext that embed expressions. There is Xbase, which can be easily consumed and implements a fully-fledged base expression language. So why not just use Xbase? There are reasons sometimes not to do so. Mostly because of three reasons: Performance, the need for another typesystem (Xbase is bound to the Java typesystem), or when no dependency on JDT is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;screenshot 21&quot; class=&quot;  wp-image-855 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;347&quot; src=&quot;https://kthoms.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/screenshot-21.png?w=462&amp;amp;h=347&quot; width=&quot;462&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you can learn a lot from the Xbase grammar. When you look at this grammar, it seems complex and makes much use of some more advanced Xtext grammar concepts like Syntactic Predicates or Assign Actions. Many Xtext users are not aware of that, or don’t understand them. So I explained them and where to use them, and I showed some patterns that any expression language follows in Xtext. The patterns are not that visible on first sight, but I gave another view on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a slight delay because of after-session discussion I joined Martin Lippert’s talk “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017/session/implementing-language-servers-good-bad-ugly&quot;&gt;Implementing Language Servers – the Good, the Bad, the Ugly&lt;/a&gt;“. Martin did a great presentation about lessons learned from implementing and using multiple language &lt;img alt=&quot;IMG_4666&quot; class=&quot;  wp-image-973 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;373&quot; src=&quot;https://kthoms.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_4666.jpg?w=280&amp;amp;h=373&quot; width=&quot;280&quot; /&gt;servers, and the state of the LSP. If you are interested in LSP and missed it, look for the recorded session. I gave Martin later direct feedback on his good performance (as he always does).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was right before the first session when &lt;a href=&quot;https://jaxenter.de/author/dominik&quot;&gt;Dominik Mohilo from jaxenter.de&lt;/a&gt; showed up. He is continuously reporting interesting stuff in his online articles for years now, and helping Eclipse to get more intention in the developers’ minds in Germany. Thus I really value his work and was excited to finally meet him in person. Many thinks about Eclipse I read from him first, because they show up in my Facebook timeline and often I read those articles. He was even more excited to finally meet the drivers behind Eclipse in person. He wrote already a &lt;a href=&quot;https://jaxenter.de/eclipse-weekly-ee4j-openj9-eclipsecon-63515&quot;&gt;good wrap up about ECE 2017&lt;/a&gt; for his Eclipse Weekly newsletter (german).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News on Photon, GEF and the Jigsaw&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I invited Dominik to join our next ignite talks. Now it was my time to present brand new stuff. I showed some of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.8/&quot;&gt;things that were added from Photon milestone 1 to 3&lt;/a&gt;, and even some of the things that are just about to come by my contributions. Besides some nice usability features and now fully working dark theme, I showed one of the most important things that users can await:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;screenshot 131&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-980&quot; src=&quot;https://kthoms.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/screenshot-131.png?w=584&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am investigating from time to time where I think Eclipse could perform better and if I have ideas on that. Some additions that I am proud of are the “Expand All” action in the Search Views’s tree. I showed both Oxygen and Photon for a search result of ~5000 elements, and the improvement is at least factor 2. Also in this demo you could see another nice feature coming for macOS: The wait-cursor was an ugly black/white circle. I found a hidden gem in macOS to get an animated system cursor. Actually it is so hidden that you just hear rumors on this blue spinning ball on the net and almost find no pictures of it with a Google search. It is not documented, but I found a hint for it in a source file of macOS. I think it looks now much nicer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://kthoms.wordpress.com/2017/10/27/eclipsecon-europe-2017-part-2/image-uploaded-from-ios5/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail&quot; height=&quot;113&quot; src=&quot;https://kthoms.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/image-uploaded-from-ios5.jpg?w=150&amp;amp;h=113&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://kthoms.wordpress.com/2017/10/27/eclipsecon-europe-2017-part-2/image-uploaded-from-ios6/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail&quot; height=&quot;113&quot; src=&quot;https://kthoms.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/image-uploaded-from-ios6.jpg?w=150&amp;amp;h=113&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also the improved speed of progress monitor updates I could show in difference between &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n64DdOa16yc&quot;&gt;Oxygen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJlrgTT2hdA&quot;&gt;Photon&lt;/a&gt;, which is just amazingly faster now. You will recognize this for example if you import projects from the Git Repository view. At the moment I am analyzing the performance of the (Java) text editor and have some patches pending. On my machine it feels already snappy again. I think the conference attendees around enjoyed my performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;screenshot 132&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-982&quot; src=&quot;https://kthoms.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/screenshot-132.png?w=584&quot; /&gt;Next it was Alexander Nyßen to talk about “How we saved GEF from the Jigsaw”. To the luck of the GEF project they were one of the very early adopters of Java 9 and tested what implications Java 9 brought for GEF. They wanted of course to assure that GEF will be compatible to Java 9 once it is out, and found some issues. And they got in direct contact with the guys from Oracle to request some changes GEF and others would need. Users of GEF can be happy now, GEF works smoothly on Java 9!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My afternoon talk schedule&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;IMG_4667&quot; class=&quot;  wp-image-985 alignleft&quot; height=&quot;356&quot; src=&quot;https://kthoms.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_4667.jpg?w=475&amp;amp;h=356&quot; width=&quot;475&quot; /&gt;The next session I attended was Andreas Graf’s presentation “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017/session/large-scale-model-transformations-xtend&quot;&gt;Large Scale Model Transformations with Xtend&lt;/a&gt;“. As written in my previous post, model transformations are one of the main use cases for Xtend, but only known by a few people. Andreas is working in the automotive sector, where you usually have VERY large models, sometimes hundreds of megabytes in source. Transforming them is challenging, and they initially did an evaluation on different technologies (e.g. QVT-O). They finally decided to use Xtend. Some of the reasons were Xtend’s performance and debuggability. Did you ever tried to debug an interpreter on a large model? It’s horrible. With Xtend you can just debug the code and also down to its transpiled Java code. And they do not experience serious bugs with Xtend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I skipped one slot and went to our booth, where I joined some discussions with attendees and colleagues. Then it became time to listen to Olaf Gunkel’s talk “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017/session/%E2%80%9C-future-async%E2%80%9D-or-java-concurrency-change-time&quot;&gt;the Future is async – or Java Concurrency in the change of time&lt;/a&gt;“. He explained concurrency programming from Java 1.0 to Java 9, and the different paradigms. I actually learned quite something about the newest stuff, reactive streams. Also Completable Future I do not use frequently – until yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;img_4668.jpg&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-991&quot; src=&quot;https://kthoms.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/img_4668-e1509133746847.jpg?w=584&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Eclipse Stammtisch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was the last talk for Tuesday and finally time to get beer at the Stammtisch, which took place in the theater’s foyer where our booth was. We made a small “flash mob”: All of us got the same T-Shirt, one with the funny bunny we had on our rollup at EclipseCon France. And suddenly it could be recognized how large the itemis crowd was. Around 20 persons from itemis, from which 8 were speakers with 12 talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://kthoms.wordpress.com/2017/10/27/eclipsecon-europe-2017-part-2/image-uploaded-from-ios3/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail&quot; height=&quot;113&quot; src=&quot;https://kthoms.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/image-uploaded-from-ios3.jpg?w=150&amp;amp;h=113&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://kthoms.wordpress.com/2017/10/27/eclipsecon-europe-2017-part-2/image-uploaded-from-ios4/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail&quot; height=&quot;113&quot; src=&quot;https://kthoms.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/image-uploaded-from-ios4.jpg?w=150&amp;amp;h=113&quot; width=&quot;150&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://kthoms.wordpress.com/2017/10/27/eclipsecon-europe-2017-part-2/20171024_180134/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail&quot; height=&quot;150&quot; src=&quot;https://kthoms.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/20171024_180134.jpg?w=113&amp;amp;h=150&quot; width=&quot;113&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It must have been a nightmare for the EclipseCon’s program committee to choose from so many talks. Of course they will tend to provide a diverse program and don’t let single companies a too big focus. But that we were able to give 12 talks shows that they believed in the quality of our content and presentation. And no, we had no one from itemis at the program committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could not remember to whom I spoke at the reception all to, but one was different: I met Brian de Alwis, who made all the way from Canada to EclipseCon Europe. It was at EclipseConverge &amp;amp; DevoxxUS where I got to know him. We had the same &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.de/Hotel_Review-g33020-d81625-Reviews-Pacific_Motor_Inn-San_Jose_California.html#photos;geo=33020&amp;amp;detail=81625&amp;amp;ff=257941736&amp;amp;albumViewMode=hero&amp;amp;aggregationId=101&amp;amp;albumid=101&amp;amp;baseMediaId=257941736&amp;amp;thumbnailMinWidth=50&amp;amp;cnt=30&amp;amp;offset=-4&amp;amp;filter=7&amp;amp;autoplay=&quot;&gt;shitty over-expensive hotel&lt;/a&gt; and met at breakfast. It was always refreshing to speak with him, a very nice guy. Actually it was him who partially sparked my interest to contribute to Eclipse Platform. The story behind would be worth another post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The real conference&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The party was of course not over when the last beer was served at the reception. It just begun. Of course it was again time to go over to Nestor, drink more beer and talk with all the Eclipse members that were joining there. At the bar there is happening the real conference. This is were you really have time to talk and learn to know new people. Year by year it gets more. At 1:30 AM I finally got to my room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh gosh, and this was just Tuesday! Wednesday would become even more intense, read about that in my next post. Our &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/2yNnIs9&quot;&gt;slides are available for download&lt;/a&gt; now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/kthoms.wordpress.com/902/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/kthoms.wordpress.com/902/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=kthoms.wordpress.com&amp;amp;blog=6829080&amp;amp;post=902&amp;amp;subd=kthoms&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Karsten Thoms: EclipseCon Europe 2017 – Part 1</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://kthoms.wordpress.com/?p=866</guid>
	<link>https://kthoms.wordpress.com/2017/10/26/eclipsecon-europe-2017-part-1/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Without any doubt this year &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017&quot;&gt;EclipseCon Europe&lt;/a&gt; was the most intense one for me. So intense that I have to split my look back into several parts. I met lots of community members again, and gained more new connections than in past events. The work in advance to this EclipseCon Europe were exhausting. I had as always work for customers to do, prepare my talks and then we also had the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.itemis.com/en/eclipse-xtext-2.13-is-released&quot;&gt;release of Xtext 2.13&lt;/a&gt; right before EclipseCon. Of course this ment much work, but we from the Xtext team were able to ship the release right on time on October 20th. I was doubting that I could stay long in the evenings at Nestor bar for talking with those great people. I was proofed to be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;DM4hMLXX0AAJEuT.jpg_large.jpg&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-891&quot; src=&quot;https://kthoms.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/dm4hmlxx0aajeut_large.jpg?w=584&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave a preview to EclipseCon Europe in &lt;a href=&quot;https://kthoms.wordpress.com/2017/10/18/next-stop-eclipsecon-europe-2017/&quot;&gt;my previous post,&lt;/a&gt; and actually it quite matched what I experienced. But let’s start at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My travel started on sunday noon, since I wanted to meet with the Eclipse Scout community for a pre-conference dinner at the Rossknecht restaurant &amp;amp; brewery. I was traveling by train to use the time for working on my talks. I had 2 talks at the main conference, 1 for the unconference and 2 ignite talks for our booth. More on that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed meeting the Scout community members as always, especially with the project leads Matthias Zimmermann and Andreas Hoegger from BSI AG. Later that evening also the members from the Eclipse Foundation joined, and I was warmly welcomed by them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday I was there for the Unconference and joined the track &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017/schedule_item/guided-tour-eclipse-modeling&quot;&gt;Guided Tour on Eclipse Modeling&lt;/a&gt;, where a broad variation of overview talks were held on the various subprojects of the Eclipse Modeling Project. I especially enjoyed Ed Merk’s talk on the Eclipse Modeling Framework. Of course, everyone in the audience knew EMF, so Ed decided not to give a normal talk about it, but a Presentation Zen talk. For example, he explained us bug replication in EMF with a photo like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon I gave my first talk: An overview on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xtend-lang.org/&quot;&gt;Xtend language&lt;/a&gt;, which I am maintaining and heavily use. Xtend is a full fledged programming language for the JVM, and makes Java development much sweeter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;screenshot 90.png&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-882&quot; src=&quot;https://kthoms.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/screenshot-90.png?w=584&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every programming language has its strengths, and to explain where Xtend has its strengths I took a look back on where Xtend came from: It goes back to the openArchitectureWare project and its successor Eclipse Xpand and the languages it provided. The Eclipse project Xpand is a template language and thus used for code generation. In Xtend this resulted in the famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/xtend/documentation/203_xtend_expressions.html#templates&quot;&gt;Template Expressions&lt;/a&gt;. Another less known feature are Create Extensions, which are essential to write Model-to-Model Transformations. In his great talk “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017/session/large-scale-model-transformations-xtend&quot;&gt;Using the Xtend language for M2M transformation&lt;/a&gt;” Andreas Graf showed this application of Xtend for large scale transformations of models from the automotive sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Unconference I met the first colleagues at the Nestor bar for a beer. This was followed by a reception at the conference venue. More itemis colleagues joined and it was time to chat with some friends from the community. Especially I talked a bit more with Michael Keppler from ETAS, with whom I was also talking much during the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course the evening was not over after the reception. This was the time to meet again at the Nestor bar, the place to be after long conference days. First we had dinner with all itemis colleagues that were there then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;DM4hdbBXcAAgPOb.jpg_large.jpg&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-878&quot; src=&quot;https://kthoms.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/dm4hdbbxcaagpob_large.jpg?w=584&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1st line: Prajwal Gowda, Arshad Adavani, Bettina Zarnekow, me, Holger Schill&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2nd line: Hendrik Bünder, Alexander Nyßen, Darius Jockel, Olaf Gunkel, Christian Dietrich&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3rd line: Matthias Wienand, Marek Derdzinski, Michael Langhammer, Sebastian Zarnekow, Torsten Görk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit later also Patrik Suzzi, Platform UI committer and our new colleague at itemis Switzerland, arrived. I met Patrik at EclipseCon Toulouse this year and not long after he joined itemis. It was nice to see him again and talk about his current project at a well-known swiss bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the bar later I spoke with many, many people. I especially enjoiyed to talk with Mickael Istria, who acknowledged my contributions to Eclipse Platform and encouraged me to continue. What I certainly will do. It was also the time to thank Dani Megert and Stephan Herrmann, who helped us to avoid a desaster for Xtext with our JDT integration for Eclipse Oxygen.1a. Instead of a problem it turned to be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.itemis.com/en/about-the-power-of-open-source-development-at-eclipse&quot;&gt;success story about what it means to work together on professional open source projects at Eclipse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were so many other people I spoke to at this evening: Mike Milinkovich, Ralph Müller, Angelika Wittek, Mickael Barbero, Torkild Resheim, Tom Schindl and many more. It was just awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this was just until Monday, before the EclipseCon really started. On Monday I left the Nestor bar at 0:30 AM, we had to wake up early and I had to give my next talks on Tuesday. Time to get some sleep now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I hope to write the second part of my look back and will upload my presentations. You can get all slides from me and the numerous from my other collegues here: &lt;span class=&quot;js-display-url&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/2yNnIs9&quot;&gt;bit.ly/2yNnIs9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/kthoms.wordpress.com/866/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/kthoms.wordpress.com/866/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=kthoms.wordpress.com&amp;amp;blog=6829080&amp;amp;post=866&amp;amp;subd=kthoms&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Wayne Beaton: Running a Successful Open Source Project</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://waynebeaton.wordpress.com/?p=5396</guid>
	<link>https://waynebeaton.wordpress.com/2017/10/26/running-a-successful-open-source-project/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post is based on a talk that Gunnar Wagenknecht and I delivered at the Open Source Leadership Summit 2017 and Devoxx US 2017. This content was recently published in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jaxenter.com/jax-magazine-eyes-open-source-138389.html&quot;&gt;All Eyes on Open Source&lt;/a&gt; issue of JAX Magazine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Running a Succesful Open Source Project - Slides&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-5403&quot; src=&quot;https://waynebeaton.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/running-a-succesful-open-source-project-slides.png?w=640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running an open source project is easy. All you have to do is make your source code available and you’re open source, right? Well, maybe. Ultimately, whether or not an open source project is successful depends on your definition of success. Regardless of your definition, creating an open source project can be a lot of work. If you have goals regarding adoption, for example, then you need to be prepared to invest. While open source software is “free as in beer”, it’s not really free: time and energy are valuable resources and these valuable resources need to be invested in the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how do you invest those resources?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Define success.&lt;/strong&gt; Before you can consider running a successful open source project, you need to have a clear definition of success. There are many factors to consider. Is it enough to just get some code into a publicly accessible repository or do you want more for your project? Is collaboration and adoption important to you? Are you just trying to build your reputation as as software developer? Does your definition of success long include long term viability? Do you want to grow a community around the project? Do you care about commercial adoption? Your answer to these questions can help you decide how many of the rest of our recommendations you’ll need to adopt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be transparent.&lt;/strong&gt; Transparency is pretty simple to understand: make it so that the community can watch and understand what you’re doing: use a publicly accessible source code repository that’s easy to find, use public facing issue tracking software, post your release plans where the community can find them, and capture meeting minutes in public forums (e.g. mailing lists with archives).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be open.&lt;/strong&gt; For a lot of open source projects, “transparency” and “openness” mean the same thing, but the terms really are quite different. Being open is more than just being “open book” (which is essentially the same thing as transparency). For many, the “open” in open source means open to new ideas, or open to participation. The rules for participating in an open source project should be the same for everybody (“level playing field”): it’s not enough to just accept a few patches, you have to be open to new ideas. In short, you have to let others in and give up absolute control of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep the “Playing Field Level”.  &lt;/strong&gt;This doesn’t necessarily mean that you have to let just anybody join the project, but rather that you ensure that the same set of rules apply to everybody (the playing field may be level, but you still have to earn your way onto the field). Meritocracy is about earning your way in.  Some projects implement meritocracy, for example, by requiring that developers make some number of contributions to demonstrate that they understand the code, rules, and culture of the project before inviting them to join the project team. Make sure that the process for adding new developers to your project are well known and that the process is operated transparently (e.g. a public vote).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be vendor neutral.&lt;/strong&gt; In order to be truly open, people need to feel welcome to contribute. This is easier if the project is vendor neutral. A vendor neutral project is not dominated by any organization or organizations; meritocracy should be based on the contributions of an individual, not the goals or hiring practices of any specific organization. Hosting at vendor neutral foundation is one way to achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have well defined and documented standards.&lt;/strong&gt; Be sure to document your project’s code formatting rules (make code formatter preferences easily accessible), expectations with regard to test coverage, development methodology, software and tools required, channels to connect with the project team, and other important information for potential contributors. Capture all of this information and make it as easy as possible to find. It’s a good practice to include a contribution guide in the root of your projects source code repositories (with DVCS, it’s entirely possible that potential contributors will find a copy of a copy of a copy of your repository; having the contribution guide in the repository will make it easy for potential contributors to find their way home).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure that the project code is always buildable.&lt;/strong&gt; Include build scripts and instructions with the project code. Make it as easy as possible to successfully build and test the project code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connect with your user community.&lt;/strong&gt; The user community is that group of people who use the products of your open source project. The user community rarely contributes anything directly to the project code, but does tend to ask a lot of questions. Make sure that those questions get answered. A healthy user community feeds an adopter community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connect with your adopter community.&lt;/strong&gt; An obvious sign of success for an open source project is that other groups start to use your open source project in their own products, or build extensions. This community is more willing to give back to the project and will be the project’s best source of contributions. Some number of those contributors will be great candidates to join your project’s team. Development of an eco-system of adopters and extenders is a great way to ensure the longevity of your project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connect with your development community.&lt;/strong&gt; The development community is comprised of your project’s team members and contributors. Provide well-known channels for communication within this community. Having clear lines of communication will help developers collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a plan.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s easy to lapse into a pattern of just letting software development happen, but like any process (especially a software development process), having  some method to the madness is critical. Make sure that your project employs a development methodology and make sure that somebody owns the process (e..g a project lead). Having a plan helps developers know where they can contribute the most value and makes it easier for adopters and extenders to implement their own plans (and thereby be successful). Treat your open source project like any other software development project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage your brand.&lt;/strong&gt; Your project will have a brand. The project’s name is its identity; as is the project logo, along with the names of any products (it’s typical that an the products of an open source project share the name of the project, but some projects produce more than one product). Claim the project’s brand as a trademark and consider registering that trademark. Establish trademark usage guidelines so that adopters know how to use your brand. This is an area where working with an open source software foundation can add value. A foundation can hold and defend the project’s trademarks on behalf of the community. This avoids letting any particular individual or organization hold the project’s name hostage (this happens).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage Intellectual property and copyright.&lt;/strong&gt; The code, documentation, and other artifacts contributed to the project is intellectual property. Who owns that intellectual property? Do the authors retain their ownership, or do they assign it to another entity? Make sure that the rights and responsibilities of contributors are understood by all contributors. Consider having contributors sign a developer certificate of origin (DCO) or a contributor license agreement (CLA). Ensure that copyright notices are included with the source code and in notices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that it is unlikely that the project itself is a legal entity that can hold copyrights. This is another way in which an open source foundation can provide a valuable service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pick an OSI-approved open source license.&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t create your own custom license; that will just add legal hurdles for anybody who wants to use your code. Make sure that the license that you choose is compatible with the manner in which you intend for the code to be used. Further, ensure that the license is compatible with any third party content (e.g. libraries) that your project code needs. Include the SPDX code for your license in the headers for all source files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move your project to an open source foundation.&lt;/strong&gt; We’ve mentioned foundations a few times already. A foundation can first and foremost help you to keep your project vendor neutral, which will help adoption: a bit part of the appeal of open source software is that adopters can avoid being beholden to a particular organization. A foundation can hold onto and defend the project’s trademarks, establish a governance model, help you manage your brand, provide intellectual property management services, and just generally provide assistance and advice for operating a successful open source project. Being a part of an open source foundation provides a value feedback loop. The foundation provides credibility for your open source project which in turn provides credibility to the foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running an open source project is a lot of work. But, as we’ve suggested, how much work it takes really depends on your definition of success. Fall back on the core principles of open source development: transparency, openness, and meritocracy. Everything else comes from that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/waynebeaton.wordpress.com/5396/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/waynebeaton.wordpress.com/5396/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=waynebeaton.wordpress.com&amp;amp;blog=19425814&amp;amp;post=5396&amp;amp;subd=waynebeaton&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Today’s news is about my support for the OMG’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/About-BPMN/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Business Process Model and Notation&lt;/a&gt;, or BPMN: It is now supported on my Oxygen version!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you want me to help you model a business process? Then I invite you to try my updated Papyrus BPMN v0.9.1 feature (implementing BPMN 2.0) available in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/papyrus-bpmn&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eclipse Marketplace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Andy Clement: AspectJ 1.9.0.RC1 released</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4252978514266184993.post-807719432491364603</guid>
	<link>http://andrewclement.blogspot.com/2017/10/aspectj-190rc1-released.html</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The first release candidate of AspectJ 1.9 is out. This is the version to use if working on Java 9 - but it also works on Java 8 too. It includes a recent version of the Eclipse Java9 compiler (from JDT Core, commit #062ac5d7a6bf9).  It does support basic usage of Java 9 modules and attempts to make the various pieces of the AspectJ distribution play nicely in Java 9.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 1.9.0.RC1 release candidate is available from the following repository:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;repository&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;id&amp;gt;repo.spring.io&amp;lt;/id&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;name&amp;gt;SpringSource milestones&amp;lt;/name&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;    &amp;lt;url&amp;gt;http://repo.spring.io/milestone&amp;lt;/url&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/repository&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Automatic Modules&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key jars in an AspectJ distribution have been given automatic module names.  The automatic module name is &lt;tt&gt;org.aspectj.runtime&lt;/tt&gt; for the &lt;tt&gt;aspectjrt&lt;/tt&gt; module:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$ java --module-path &amp;lt;pathto&amp;gt;/lib/aspectjrt.jar --list-modules | grep aspectj&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;org.aspectj.runtime file:///&amp;lt;pathto&amp;gt;/lib/aspectjrt.jar automatic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;And similarly &lt;tt&gt;org.aspectj.weaver&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;org.aspectj.tools&lt;/tt&gt; for &lt;tt&gt;aspectjweaver&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;aspectjtools&lt;/tt&gt; respectively:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$ java --module-path &amp;lt;pathto&amp;gt;/lib/aspectjweaver.jar --describe-module org.aspectj.weaver&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;org.aspectj.weaver file:///&amp;lt;pathto&amp;gt;/lib/aspectjweaver.jar automatic&lt;br /&gt;requires java.base mandated&lt;br /&gt;contains aj.org.objectweb.asm&lt;br /&gt;contains aj.org.objectweb.asm.signature&lt;br /&gt;contains org.aspectj.apache.bcel&lt;br /&gt;contains org.aspectj.apache.bcel.classfile&lt;br /&gt;contains org.aspectj.apache.bcel.classfile.annotation&lt;br /&gt;contains org.aspectj.apache.bcel.generic&lt;br /&gt;contains org.aspectj.apache.bcel.util&lt;br /&gt;contains org.aspectj.asm&lt;br /&gt;contains org.aspectj.asm.internal&lt;br /&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Building woven modules&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AspectJ understands module-info.java source files and building modules that include aspects. Here is an example:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;module-info.java&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;module demo {&lt;br /&gt; exports pkg;&lt;br /&gt; requires org.aspectj.runtime;&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;pkg/Demo.java&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;package pkg;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;public class Demo {&lt;br /&gt; public static void main(String[] argv) {&lt;br /&gt;  System.out.println(&quot;Demo running&quot;);&lt;br /&gt; }&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;otherpkg/Azpect.java&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;package otherpkg;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;public aspect Azpect {&lt;br /&gt; before(): execution(* *(..)) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !within(Azpect) {&lt;br /&gt;  System.out.println(&quot;Azpect running&quot;);&lt;br /&gt; }&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;We can now build those into a module:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$ ajc -1.9 module-info.java otherpkg/Azpect.java pkg/Demo.java -outjar demo.jar&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;module-info.java:3 [error] org.aspectj.runtime cannot be resolved to a module&lt;br /&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wait, that failed!  Yes, &lt;tt&gt;aspectjrt.jar&lt;/tt&gt; (which includes the required &lt;tt&gt;org.aspectj.weaver&lt;/tt&gt; module) wasn't supplied. We need to pass it on the module-path:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$ ajc -1.9 --module-path &amp;lt;pathto&amp;gt;/aspectjrt.jar module-info.java otherpkg/Azpect.java &lt;br /&gt;    pkg/Demo.java -outjar demo.jar&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now we have a demo module we can run:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$ java --module-path &amp;lt;pathto&amp;gt;/aspectjrt.jar:demo.jar --module demo/pkg.Demo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Azpect running&lt;br /&gt;Demo running&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;That's it!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3&gt;Binary weaving with modules&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A module is really just a jar with a module-info descriptor. As such you can simply pass a module on the &lt;tt&gt;inpath&lt;/tt&gt;and binary weave it with other aspects.  Take the module we built above, let's weave into it again:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;extra/AnotherAzpect.java&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;package extra;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;public aspect AnotherAzpect {&lt;br /&gt; before(): execution(* *(..)) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !within(*Azpect) {&lt;br /&gt;  System.out.println(&quot;AnotherAzpect running&quot;);&lt;br /&gt; }&lt;br /&gt;}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$ ajc -inpath demo.jar AnotherAzpect.java -outjar newdemo.jar&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Notice how there was no complaint here that the &lt;tt&gt;org.aspectj.runtime&lt;/tt&gt; module hadn't been passed in. That is because &lt;tt&gt;inpath&lt;/tt&gt;was being used which doesn't treat specified jars as modules (and so does not check dependencies). There is no &lt;tt&gt;module-inpath&lt;/tt&gt; right now.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the new jar produced includes the compiled aspect, the module-info specification inside is still correct, so we can run it exactly as before:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ java --module-path &amp;lt;pathto&amp;gt;/aspectjrt.jar:newdemo.jar --module demo/pkg.Demo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Azpect running&lt;br /&gt;AnotherAzpect running&lt;br /&gt;Demo running&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Faster Spring AOP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This version also includes the Spring AOP enhancements made in AspectJ 1.8.12 - as covered &lt;a href=&quot;http://andrewclement.blogspot.ca/2017/10/aspectj-1812-faster-spring-aop.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;More to come...&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eclipse JDT Java 9 support is still being actively worked on and lots of fixes will be coming through over the next few months and included in AspectJ 1.9.X revisions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AspectJ does not currently modify &lt;tt&gt;module-info.java&lt;/tt&gt; files. An aspect from one module applying to code in another module clearly introduces a dependency between those two modules. There is no reason - other than time! - that this can't be done. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=526244&quot;&gt;Issue 526244&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related to that AspectJ, on detection of aspects should be able to automatically introduce the &lt;tt&gt;requires org.aspectj.runtime&lt;/tt&gt; to the &lt;tt&gt;module-info&lt;/tt&gt;. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=526242&quot;&gt;Issue 526242&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Module aware variants of AspectJ paths: &lt;tt&gt;--module-inpath&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;--module-aspectpath&lt;/tt&gt;. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=526243&quot;&gt;Issue 526243&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are probably other use cases to be considered too (and bugs no doubt!), feel free to raise all these in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/enter_bug.cgi?product=AspectJ&quot;&gt;Bugzilla&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;I was happy to discover that Bluzio [?] posted, in the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xmleye.wordpress.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Robots y modelos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; blog, very detailed instructions on how you can be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xmleye.wordpress.com/2017/10/17/running-uml-rt-models-on-a-raspberry-pi-based-rover/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Running UML-RT models on a Raspberry Pi-based rover&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;group&quot; id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;post-580 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-uncategorized&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, this was done using my own tool implementing UML-RT: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/papyrus-rt/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Papyrus for Real Time&lt;/a&gt; (Also see &lt;a href=&quot;https://papyrusuml.wordpress.com/links/&quot;&gt;Links&lt;/a&gt; page)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog post contains a detailed example on how to use Papyrus-RT in robotic applications! It discuss everything from the hardware used (based on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polarsys.org/projects/polarsys.rover&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PolarSys Rover&lt;/a&gt;) to the software generated with Papyrus-RT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are into robots and open source software, you must &lt;a href=&quot;https://xmleye.wordpress.com/2017/10/17/running-uml-rt-models-on-a-raspberry-pi-based-rover/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;go and read that post&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;post-580 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-uncategorized&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bluzio, I hope you will read this blog and &lt;a href=&quot;https://papyrusuml.wordpress.com/contact-us/&quot;&gt;let me know who you are&lt;/a&gt; so you, and your university, can be publicly thanked for your work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;: Thank you to &lt;strong&gt;Antonio Garcia-Dominguez&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;Aston University&lt;/strong&gt;‘s  School of Engineering &amp;amp; Applied Science for all this material!&lt;/p&gt;

	<guid isPermaLink="true">https://blogs.itemis.com/en/a-birds-view-on-language-servers</guid>
	<link>https://blogs.itemis.com/en/a-birds-view-on-language-servers</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;To write computer programs different programming languages are used, often multiple languages for one piece of software. While programs can be written with very basic text editor like NotePad or vi, normally dedicated programming tools are used that give developers a more integrated and guided way of editing code. IDEs (Integrated Development Environment) usually support several languages at once, or even can be extended to support more languages. Some IDEs are heavy weight desktop applications (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/home/index.php&quot;&gt;Eclipse IDE&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.visualstudio.com&quot;&gt;Visual Studio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/&quot;&gt;IntelliJ IDEA&lt;/a&gt;), others more light weight (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sublimetext.com/&quot;&gt;Sublime&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/&quot;&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt;), or even web based (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/che/&quot;&gt;Eclipse Che&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://c9.io/&quot;&gt;Cloud9&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;All these tools share a common problem: For each programming language they support it usually needs quite sophisticated integration into that tool to support rich editing features like syntax coloring, syntactic and semantic code analysis, error reporting, code proposals and many more. For each supported language, for each supported version of these languages, for each supported feature, for each tool! While in the past it was sufficient for these tools to specialize on a small subset of languages, e.g. dedicated tools for programming Java or C, or on a small subset of features like syntax coloring, it is nowadays expected from these tools to provide rich support for many languages and features.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The increasing speed of language evolution and creation of new languages makes this even worse. For most languages tool integration is hand crafted, and tool providers are struggling hard to support a broader set of languages. For domain specific languages often language development frameworks like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/&quot;&gt;Xtext&lt;/a&gt; are used. They address this problem through a combination of generic framework services and code generation: The necessary glue code for all supported editing features is produced automatically. However, these frameworks support only subset of potential IDEs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;man-working-on-laptop-language-servers.jpg&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.itemis.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog/Software%20Development/man-working-on-laptop.jpg?t=1508760439784&amp;amp;width=724&amp;amp;name=man-working-on-laptop.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 724px;&quot; title=&quot;man-working-on-laptop-language-servers.jpg&quot; width=&quot;724&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Language Servers to the rescue!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;In 2015 Microsoft started development of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; (short: VS Code), a modern open sourced light-weight IDE based on web technology. The core team is lead by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Gamma&quot;&gt;Erich Gamma&lt;/a&gt;, who was already one of the masterminds behind Eclipse IDE in the past and knew how to build scalable and extensible tool platforms. And they had again the same issue: How to integrate support for multiple languages?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;But then they had a great idea: They defined not just an API implemented in the main language of VS Code, TypeScript, but a technology agnostic protocol based on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;JSON RPC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;. And they open sourced the protocol definition. This protocol is known as the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Language Server Protocol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; (LSP).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The protocol itself defines messages and structures that are exchanged between an editor (the client) and a “language smartness provider” (the language server). The information exchanged between those two parties is a common subset of interactions that code editors and languages usually do: open/save/close files, editing text, validating code, reporting errors or log messages, search for symbol references, follow references and many more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;VS Code was of course the first programming tool that used this protocol for its own integration of TypeScript, C# and other languages, but the software development community discovered the value of such a protocol for both sides fast: tool developers could integrate any language that offers the server side of the protocol, and language developers could concentrate on designing and implementing their language without caring much on their integration into certain tools. And due to the technology agnostic nature of the protocol both sides could be implemented in any language of their choice without dealing with all the nastiness of integrating programs written in different languages.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A word on the term “server”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;When people read “server” they often think that there is some kind of server process running on a remote machine, maybe even a cloud based service. When hearing “language server” this could lead to the misunderstanding that a language server could just run on any machine and clients just need to connect and talk to that through remote communication. This is often just not true.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;data-exchange-worldwide.jpg&quot; height=&quot;344&quot; src=&quot;https://blogs.itemis.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog/Software%20Development/data-exchange-worldwide.jpg?t=1508760439784&amp;amp;width=724&amp;amp;height=344&amp;amp;name=data-exchange-worldwide.jpg&quot; width=&quot;724&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A language server often runs on the same machine as the client, often but not necessary in a separate (child) process. Besides performance aspects that developers expect when editing code, the main reason is that client and server have to share the same file system and work on the same files. When client and server are running on different machine, they need to work on a distributed file system. Some solutions follow this approach, but for most implementations nowadays just think of a language server running on the same machine and thus working on the same files as the client.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The separation of a language server process from the editing tool has another great advantage: The tool can operate with far less resources and will be more responsive while still supporting multiple languages, while the language server’s resources can be scaled independently. Users will get a fast editing experience while all the heavy-lifting stuff is performed in a background process asynchronously.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Write once – run anywhere!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Although it was not the primary intention from Microsoft’s team initially, the open and modern approach of the protocol convinced many tool and language developers to work and support on this common protocol. That way it has nowadays evolved to a de-facto standard. Java in VS Code, C# in Eclipse, TypeScript in Atom – even domain specific languages (DSLs) can be supported in any editor now. All that it takes is to implement a single protocol! And a bit tool-specific glue code to integrate a language server into specific clients.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Even if this doesn't sound that difficult, there is still a lot to be done for the providers – IDE providers need to generify their editing facilities and offer pluggable extensions for their tools. While VS Code as first provider naturally supports all features, others have to implement this. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Eclipse as a major player has various initiatives for supporting the LSP: Since Eclipse is implemented in Java, a Java implementation of the protocol is required. The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/lsp4j&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;LSP4J&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; project provides a framework that can be used for both Java based client and server implementations. With &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.lsp4e&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;LSP4E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; a common API is offered to integrate language servers through the Eclipse plug-in mechanism, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2016/11/24/deliver-support-for-new-languages-in-eclipse-ide-faster-with-generic-editor-and-language-servers/&quot;&gt;the new Generic Editor&lt;/a&gt; interacts with language servers connected to the IDE. On the language provider side the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.itemis.com/en/xtext/&quot;&gt;Xtext framework&lt;/a&gt; is implementing the protocol’s server side for textual domain specific languages, opening up the vast amount of Xtext based languages to completely new editing environments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Other widely used editing environments like Emacs, Eclipse &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/che/&quot;&gt;Eclipse Che&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;, Sublime are working on or already have support for the protocol. However, IntelliJ IDEA as one of the most used IDEs currently does not have plans to support the protocol. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEABKL-7409&quot;&gt;feature request was opened&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; but until today it does not seem that IntelliJ will work on that in the near future. While IntelliJ did a great job on attracting developers to use their IDEs, making it even more popular than Eclipse for Java and Web Development, it bares the risk that they miss jumping onto the express train where all the other cool guys are already on and celebrating parties. With the increasing speed of language evolvement they will have a hard way to keep up the speed, and will miss support of new languages. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;This is a chance for a renaissance of Eclipse, and the Eclipse community is doing a great job on modernizing and stabilizing the core IDE. Other IDEs have the chance to get a bigger piece of the pizza, and developers are free to choose whatever tool and language they favor without tool lock-in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
